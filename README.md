# hassq

Very early, dumb and naive implementation of a cli for Home Assistant using Quarkus.

Do NOT use this for anything serious and do NOT expect it to work nor is the code/structure
anywhere near final.


## Basic usage examples

List state with entity id contains "kitchen"

```
export HASS_TOKEN=your-token
hassq state list kitchen
```


## Background

Around 2018/2019 I started to use Home Assistant and I really liked it. I also started to
move forward the hass-cli python project (https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant-cli) to 
the extent it had several releases and became really useful for me. You can read more about it [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2019/02/04/introducing-home-assistant-cli/) and even got on the podcast [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8AQrlfwfCg).

However, I went on a sabbatical and got to work on other things. I also got back to using Java and
just didn't have the time to work on the hass-cli project. 

Now some years later I'm back to using Home Assistant and hass-cli recently haven't had working releases
and xmas 2024 I really wanted to have a working cli for Home Assistant. So I decided to start a new Java
based on using Quarkus.

Thus this is not trying to displace hass-cli but rather be a new alternative. 

Not sure where it will go but at least I have a working cli for my own use now and I have a way to test Quarkus developer experience.
